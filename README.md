# Recursion Problems

## Definitions
Define the following: 
- Recursion: when a method calls itself
- Recursive Case: conditional that results in recursive call
- Base Case: non-recursive solution
- Activation Chain/Function Call Stack: collection of method calls 
- Activation Record/Function Call: a call that is in the call stack
- Infinite Recursion/Stack Overflow/Stack too deep: when there is no basecase to pull you out of a recursive method. Your computer runs out of available memory in the stack
- Tail Recursion: computation before recursion. Can be better for memory management.
